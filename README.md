# Money Manager

## Checkout the Project on heroku [here](http://ernest-money-manager.herokuapp.com)

The reason I wantd to create this application was to help me managing my income and savings during both my co-op terms and work terms while studying at the University of Waterloo. By utilizing this application, I hoped to understand and better manage my income so that I can maintain a decent amount of savings after I come out of university. Some of my features that I hope to put into this application were recording expenses, incomes by catagories and date of records. In my dashboard, I hope to display a summary of my monthly expenses and incomes to help me see the effect of my overall actions. Some features that I hope to incorporate into this application was calculating my OSAP loans and grants. One of the reasons I wanted to do this was because there wasn't really an application to show the big picture and effects of taking the OSAP loans and grants. 

Through this application I was able to present the front-end using React, the back-end using Node.js and Express.js and I was able to store the data using Mongodb and mongoose. Furthermore, I was able to learn how to use jwt tokens to help with authorization and private routes to my api. Additionally, I used heroku to deploy this application so that I could access it on any computer and any location.

I Hope that in the future I can also recreate this application for mobile so that I can add expenses and incomes anywhere so that I can record items even when I'm on the go. 

I hope you take the time to check out my project in the link above and feel free to give me feedback through my social media links which can be found [here](https://ernestchiu.com)
