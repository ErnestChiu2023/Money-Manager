# Money-Manager

Creating a MERN stack application to practice learning all parts of the stack

- This project is going to be created with four technologies
- mongodb
- express.js
- react.js
- node.js

For the front end, I will be utilizing react.js to handle all user interactions
and for the back end I will be utilizing node.js, express to handle all server requests.
Then for the database I will utilize mongodb to store all information

This application is meant for me to track my expenses through out the past months.
I will then generate statistics with this information such as

- how much money I used per month
- What I spend most of my money on
- What days I spend the most on
- how I can save more money
